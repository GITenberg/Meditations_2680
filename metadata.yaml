description: The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (a.d. 121'180) embodied in
  his person that deeply cherished, ideal figure of antiquity, the philosopher-king.
  His Meditations are not only one of the most important expressions of the Stoic
  philosophy of his time but also an enduringly inspiring guide to living a good and
  just life. Written in moments snatched from military campaigns and the rigors of
  politics, these ethical and spiritual reflections reveal a mind of exceptional clarity
  and originality, and a spirit attuned to both the particulars of human destiny and
  the vast patterns that underlie it. From the Hardcover edition.
